# Note for users:
# --------------
# Site-specific entries for different HPC centers are given at the bottom of
# this file. Comment out/replace as needed. This default version of the file
# can be used in combination with the command line argument
# ``search_esgf=when_missing``. If only certain values are allowed for an
# option, these are listed after ``---``. The option in square brackets is the
# default value, i.e., the one that is used if this option is omitted in the
# file.

# Note for developers:
# -------------------
# Two identical copies of this file (``ESMValTool/config-user-example.yml`` and
# ``ESMValCore/esmvalcore/config-user.yml``) exist. If you change one of it,
# make sure to apply the changes to the other.

# Automatic data download from ESGF --- [never]/when_missing/always
# Use automatic download of missing CMIP3, CMIP5, CMIP6, CORDEX, and obs4MIPs
# data from ESGF. ``never`` disables this feature, which is useful if you are
# working on a computer without an internet connection, or if you have limited
# disk space. ``when_missing`` enables the automatic download for files that
# are not available locally. ``always`` will always check ESGF for the latest
# version of a file, and will only use local files if they correspond to that
# latest version.
search_esgf: never

# Directory for storing downloaded climate data
# Make sure to use a directory where you can store multiple GBs of data. Your
# home directory on a HPC is usually not suited for this purpose, so please
# change the default value in this case!

# Rootpaths to the data from different projects
# This default setting will work if files have been downloaded by ESMValTool
# via ``search_esgf``. Lists are also possible. For site-specific entries,
# see the default ``config-user.yml`` file that can be installed with the
# command ``esmvaltool config get_config_user``. For each project, this can
# be either a single path or a list of paths. Comment out these when using a
# site-specific path.
